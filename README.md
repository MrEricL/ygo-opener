# ygo-opener

Code taken from [another repo](https://github.com/adosreis/Yugioh-Pack-Opening-Simulator)  

Random packs to build decks for YGOPro `.ydk`. Converts card names pulled from selected packs and uses YGOPRODeck API to grab card codes for `.ydk` format.  

Run `python main.py` and edit packs as needed. Cards per pack is not constant and leads to certain bugs.
